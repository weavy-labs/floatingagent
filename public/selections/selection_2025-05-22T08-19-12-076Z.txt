Plain Text:
They’re booking 40–50 enterprise meetings a week.

Still not hitting targets.

Here’s what was happening:

– No GTM plan

– No sales leader

– No structured lead qualification

– 4 junior-to-mid SDRs, and the founder managing everything

– A partner program running at 10% capacity - badly neglected

– Events bringing in leads… but no follow-up, no scoring, no conversions

𝐃𝐨𝐳𝐞𝐧𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐬. 𝐙𝐞𝐫𝐨 𝐨𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧.

They were trying it all:

→ 5 cold outreach agencies tasked with “booking meetings”

→ Gift card incentives to get demos

→ Google, LinkedIn, and Bing ads

→ Even AI SDR flows - automated agents handling outreach
